A Sharingan Theme Collection!
 
For all Naruto fans out there!

Now includes ALL sharingan eyes from Naruto! Also Rinnegan and some other stuff...

I plan to update this theme frequently and add every single Sharingan that exists in Naruto and also include different versions of each so you can fully customize it to your liking.
Also features custom Sounds which can be removed by deleting the "SuccessSound.wav" in the LockGlyph theme folder.

If you have any request for a theme (not only lockglyph) feel free to contact me, so i can fulfill that request ;)

Thank you for downloading and have fun using this!

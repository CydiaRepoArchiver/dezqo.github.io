# Dezqo's Cydia Repository
This is my personal Cydia Repository which I use to host beta packages or themes and some other stuff.
Feel free to add the repo and install anything you like. Normally, everything is well documented with an in-depth depiction.

Also, it should be noted here that I don't take responsibility if anything goes wrong or you install a package that isn't compatible with your iOS version and device.

## Installation
Add this repo to Cydia [here](http://dezqo.github.io/repo).

## Usage
Once this repo has been added to [Cydia](https://cydia.saurik.com/), it can be found within the 'Sources' section in Cydia.

## Cloning this repo
If you want to make your own repo, you can clone this repo and use it as a template. Don't forget to remove my packages and depictions though!
You can modify this README file to your own liking but please keep the credits section to honor the work of the people mentioned there!

If you have any questions or just don't know how to get the repo running, take a look at the wiki section. You can also shoot me a message right here on github and I might even answer...

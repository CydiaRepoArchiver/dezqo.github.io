# Dezqo's Cydia Repository
This is my personal Cydia Repository which I use to host beta packages or themes and some other stuff.
Feel free to add the repo and install anything you like. Normally, everything is well documented with an in-depth depiction.

Also, it should be noted here that I don't take responsibility if anything goes wrong or you install a package that isn't compatible with your iOS version and device.

## Installation
Add this repo to Cydia [here](dezqo.github.io/repo).

## Usage
Once this repo has been added to [Cydia](https://cydia.saurik.com/), it can be found within the 'Sources' section in Cydia.

## Credits
 Thanks to Travis Grammer for his [Cydia Package Depiction Template](https://codepen.io/travis-g/pen/mywWyq).
